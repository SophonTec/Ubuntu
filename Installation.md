### Macbook Air 2017
Succeed when following the process [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-macbook-pro/)

Caution: 
1. When select the "Try Ubuntu before Installing", no Wi-Fi network is shown in the Ubuntu system. After installation, the network driver is also installed.
2. Make sure to disable the SIP and use Refind for boot management.

### Macbook Pro 2019
Not succeed yet: a fatal error "grub-install /dev/nvme0n1/"

```bash
Executing 'grub-install/dev/nvme' failed.
This is a fatal error.
```

But, the Refind boot mgr will have a Ubuntu choice when I reboot. However, the Ubuntu OS works without network and needs to install RELEASE.
